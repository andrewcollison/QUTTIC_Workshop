### Hello World
# Here we will learn to print to the console


# Print a simple string
print('Hello World')

# # Alternatively define a variable and print it
# x = "hello world"
# print(x)
# ### List Demo



# ### For Loop Demo
# x = [1, 2, 3, 4 ,5]
# for i in range(len(x)):
# 	print(x[i])

# ### Anything else people want to see

# Loop = True
# x = 0
# while(Loop == True):
# 	print("Alex is a struggle")
# 	x = x +1
# 	if(x >= 23):
# 		Loop = False
